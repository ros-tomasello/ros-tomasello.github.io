## Overview
I am a cognitive neuroscientist working on the **neurobiology of language** and **neuropragmatics**. I combine high-density EEG, MEG/fMRI, and TMS with **brain-constrained neural modeling** to explain how communicative actions (requests, questions, assertions) are implemented in the brain and how symbolic knowledge is learned rapidly under biological constraints.

## Research Focus
- Neurobiology of language and pragmatics  
- Brain-constrained neural networks  
- Speech act processing and communicative functions  
- Rapid symbolic learning under biological constraints  

## Positions & Affiliations
- Substitute W3 Professorship (50%) — *Neuroscience of Language & Pragmatics*, Freie Universität Berlin  
- Research Fellow / Co-Project Leader — Cluster of Excellence **Matters of Activity**, HU Berlin

## Grants & Recognition
- DFG grant supporting work on **brain signatures of communication**  
- Editorial: *Cognitive Processing* (Springer Nature); *Contrastive Pragmatics* (Brill)

## Teaching
- Language & the Brain · Neuropragmatics · Language Evolution · Computational Modeling of Language  
- >35 BA/MA theses; co-supervision of PhD projects

## CV
See **[Curriculum Vitae](/cv/)**.
